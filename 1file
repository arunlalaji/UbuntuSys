file1 shows nothing
I have done editing successsfully this is the way we should copy the files to git 
1. create a new directory
2. initaite git repo by git init
3. add files to the directory
4. add those files to staging area git add -A # to add all files
5. by confirming commit i.e git commit -m "mesaage" we confirms changes to git repository
6. now add remote to git repository such as git remote add origin remote url
7. verify the above remote repo by git remote -v
8. now push the changes to git git push origin master
9. It means things will successfully added to the git repo
10. Thank you
